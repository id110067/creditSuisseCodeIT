#Things to consider:  Weekends, Day, and Night 
#A standard minutely rate for weekdays, and an ‘extra’ rate for weekends.
#When rates switches between day and night rates, for a total of four different rates
# (weekday/weekend + day/night).
# • For every eight hours, the robot needs to take an hour of unpaid break (or part thereof)
# for planned system maintenance.


# Calculation as 1 januaray is friday which is standard day hence the day hours are 2hours and 45 minutes = 165 minutes at a rate of 20 per minute
# standard night rate was 25 which robot on friday worked for 1 hour --> 60 * 25
# For extra day as 2nd januray is saturday, then robot works extra 4 hours 15 minutes = 255 minutes at a rate of 35 minutes

# Logic create 4 variables .i.e. Weekday day, weekday night, weekend day, weekend night
# create 4 variables to store rates for each days and night
# have a check for more than 8 hours and for each 8 hours deduct 60 minutes
